# Archrice
![General](Rin.png)

These are my config file. I make this repo because i was inspired by [luke smith](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz). He's the one reason why i'm starting to use i3 as my Go-to DE (Desktop Environment).

This ricing setup will **work** on any Linux distro, so you don't need to install Arch as long as you have i3wm installed.
