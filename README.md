# Archrice
![comfy AF](comfy.png)

These are my config file. I make this repo because i was inspired by [luke smith](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz). He's the one reason why i'm starting to use i3 as my Go-to DE (Desktop Environment).

This ricing setup will **work** on any Linux distro, so you don't need to install Arch.
## Programs that i bind are listed in here:
* ncmpcpp
* urxvt (rxvt-unicode)
* vim
* newsboat
* polybar
* rofi
* mpd
* neofetch
* ~~termite~~ (The default terminal now is urxvt, but the config are remain here)
* And many more!

## Like my rice?
You can push that star button if you find it awesome!, Also check this [guy](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz) out! Without him, i might not create this cool Repo.

### Notes:
The program that i use, might get changed. Also you need to edit it later, ~~it might breaking your DE~~ Just to make sure anything works fine.

~Happy ricing =)
