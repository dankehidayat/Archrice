These are my config file. I make this repo because i was inspired by [luke smith](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz). I steal some config from Luke *sorry~*, but the rest of the config i'm doing it on my own.

## Programs that i bind are listed in here:
* ncmpcpp
* urxvt (rxvt-unicode)
* vim
* newsboat
* polybar
* rofi
* mpd
* neofetch
* ~~termite~~ (The default terminal now is urxvt, but the config are remain here)
* And many more!
